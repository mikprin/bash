That's because of the idle-delay setting. To change it you'll have to alter the corresponding dconf key (and do that as the gdm user):

    switch to a VT (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F3), login as root and run:

    su - gdm -s /bin/sh

    to switch user to gdm.

    then run:

    export $(dbus-launch)

    and set idle delay to 0 (which translates to never):

    GSETTINGS_BACKEND=dconf gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0

    run exit or hit Ctrl+D to return to root account.

    reboot your machine or restart the display manager:

    systemctl restart gdm
